  // COMMUNITY CENTER BUNDLES  
  "Aliyah.JojaBegin": "Ah... Lewis finally caved to Joja, did he? What a shame.$2#$b#I would have liked to see what the Community Center could have been.$11",
  "Aliyah.CCBegin": "Have I seen you poking around the old Community Center?$0#$b#How wonderful, my grandparents told me such fond stories about it, you know.$1",

  "Aliyah.MovieTheater": "How strange that a theatre should crop up overnight. Rather like magic, is it not?$13#$b#Hm. Well, it is nice to have more reasons to come into town.$1",

  "Aliyah.CommunityCenter10": "It is good, is it not? To see everyone laugh, smile, and bicker?$21#$b#This monthly meetup has done us all a world of good. Thank you for fixing this place up, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}.$1",
  // FESTIVALS (DAY BEFORE)
  "Aliyah.EggFestival": "I do hope Abigail sits out the egg hunt tomorrow.$12#$b#The younger children do not need that level of competition.$11",
  "Aliyah.FlowerDance": "Tomorrow is the Flower Dance. It confused me so much when I first moved here...$1#$b#I look forward to it these days. I like dressing up.$8",
  "Aliyah.Luau": "I cannot wait until tomorrow. I spent all week thinking about the Luau.$13#$b#Even if the soup is strange, it is one of the few times of year I can get real meat.$1",

  "Aliyah.SpiritsEve": "Tricks, treats, japes and capers. Everyone letting down their hair...$1#$b#What is there not to like about Spirit's Eve?$8",
  "Aliyah.IceFestival": "I have such mixed feelings about the Ice Festival...$9#$b#It is nice to build snowmen, and to catch up with people, but the fishing seems cruel.$2",
  "Aliyah.NightMarket": "I have not yet missed a Night Market once since moving here.$13#$b#It was where I met my first husband, and his favorite. A chance to reconnect with his people. Enjoy the wonders while they linger.$1",
  "Aliyah.WinterStar": "Have you any guesses about who your secret gifter will be, tomorrow?$8#$b#I always try to sniff them out. And I always get it wrong.$3",
  // ROMANTIC (POSITIVE) 
  "Aliyah.GiveFlowersA": "Oh...? Ha!$3#$b#No I am not laughing at you, it is just that you beat me to it, precious. I had just spoken to Aideen yesterday...$4#$b#These are so very lovely. I shall be sure to find them a nice vase.$1#$e#%Aliyah leans to press a soft kiss to your cheek.",
  "Aliyah.GiveFlowersB": "%Aliyah smiles at the bouquet you've handed her, before holding it gently to her chest.#$b#How did you know I had been thinking about you...? Yes of course I will accept these.$4#$b#I have grown terrily fond of you, you know.$1",
  "Aliyah.GivePendant": "-!! Oh...$7#$b#It is really, remarkable. How after all this time, you continue to surprise me...#13#$b#You are such a treasure to everyone who knows you - and to me, most of all. I am glad you feel the same.$4#$b#I will arrange everything.

  "Aliyah.DumpedGirls": "I am sorry, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}, but I will need some time to process this pain. I am not made of stone.$11",
  "Aliyah.SecondChanceGirls": "I will not deny that this hurts, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}} - but if you are sincere about wanting to do better, I will see it through with you.$9",
  "Aliyah.Reject2HA": "I... No? I am flattered, I think, but we barely know one another...#9",
  "Aliyah.Reject2HB": "No, but - thank you? I think?#12",
  "Aliyah.Reject4HA": "Your... optimism is, moderately charming, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}, but I am not interested in you like that. I am sorry.#9",
  "Aliyah.Reject4HB": "{{Honorific}} {{Surname}}, I know that I like jokes, but this one seems in rather poor taste.#12",
  "Aliyah.EngageA": "Does your betrothed know about this? I thought you were better than that.#5$#b#I am going to do you a favor and treat this like a joke in poor taste. Leave.#11",
  "Aliyah.EngageB": "I will not be partner to this sordid indescretion - you are engaged, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}, you should not be flirting.$5",
  "Aliyah.MarriedA": "If this is your idea of a joke, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}, re-evaluate.$5",
  "Aliyah.MarriedB": "I have half a mind to tell {0} about your infidelity, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}} = they deserve better.$5",

  "Aliyah.LowHeart.2": "I moved here over fifteen years ago, now. The community has become a second family, in that time - I hope you come to feel the same.$1",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.3": "Being a farmer must foster a lot of 'growth', hm? Inspires a great deal of reward worth harvest?$13#$b#Hee, sorry. I *may* have a fondness for puns.$3",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.4": "I am sorry, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}, Spreach had a fussy night. I am afraid I did not sleep well, I cannot promise I will be good company today.$11",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.5": "I have seen a lot more of your produce for sale on my shopping trips. It is nice to be able to buy local - thank you for that.$1",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.6": "Does the whole town send you running about on errands, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}? It is kind of you to help out, but please do not push yourself too hard.$9",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.7": "Please try not to think too unkindly of the more standoffish people in town.$9#$b#I know they can be vexing, but they all try very hard to be good people, despite it all.$15",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.8": "I do not think I could have found a better life calling than therapy. It feels good to help people, does it not?$1",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.9": "Do you enjoy what you do, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}? It was a leap of faith to move here. I hope you do not regret it.$12",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.10": "It can never rain enough for me. It is my favorite weather. You may even catch me dancing in it, if you look hard enough.$1",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.11": "Are you well, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}? Have you been resting enough, eating?$0#$b#Your physical wellbeing is an important component toward good mental health. Do not neglect it.$1",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.12": "People find anxiety in the smallest mundanities, sometimes. I am honored to be trusted with them, really.$12#$b#It is a very vulernable thing, to talk about being anxious.$9",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.13": "Do you read often? A friend recommended a book to me, and I cannot put it down.$1#$b#It is a light-hearted high fantasy novel about war, gods, and what it takes to make a hero, with an undercurrent of monstrous romance.$4#$b#I can lend it to you, when I am done, if you like?$15#$e#Oh. No, this isn't for book club. I'm reading this one for me.$3",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.14": "I sometimes hear the strangest noises coming from the woods beyond my yard. I have not the faintest what they are, though.$12#$b#I have long since learned to live and let live, the things that lurk in the dark.$21",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.15": "$y 'Are you more of a cat person, or a dog person?_Dog Person._Mm. Me too. I just get along with them, I think.$1_Cat Person._Oh... You do not dislike dogs, though, do you?$15'",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.16": "I became an avid coffee lover in college, thanks in no small part to my late husband. Perhaps I'll share his recipe, someday.$8",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.17": "More and more, I am surprised by how mature the young folk here have become. I knew most of them as toddlers, you know.$3",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.18": "There are some unique challenges to working with a small community like this. All my patients are on a first-name basis with one another.$15#$b#They ask after one another often; but I am sworn to confidentiality. At least they are good-natured about my refusal to gossip.$13",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.19": "I run a book club in my home once a month for some friends in the Scarp. We all take turns picking what to read, it has been fun.$20",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.20": "Mmmm... I am sorry, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}, I am a bit sleepy today, I stayed up rather late last night.$18#$b#I was stargazing, and I just lost track of time. There is something unfathomly romantic about the night sky, is there not...?$15",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.21": "I have had dogs since I was a child. Spreach is the latest in a long line of lifetime companions.$21#$b#If I have my way, it is a procession that will last for as long as I do.$1",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.22": "Spreach got into some poison ivy, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}, please be careful if you pet him. Try to avoid his left flank.$9",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.23": "My house once belonged to my great-grandmother, and has been passed down through my maternal line ever since.$21#$b#She is still alive, but she outgrew the place an age ago.$20",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.24": "You inherited your farm from your grandfather, did you not, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}?$8#$b#I do not remember if I moved here before his passing or not, but I have heard a lot about him from Evelyn, George, and others.$15#$b#I would be happy to share those stories over tea, sometime, if you wish.$1",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.25": "I started the Book Club initially as a way of finding comfort while grieving. I have outgrown the need for grief support, however...$30#$b#It is the unfortunate truth that I keep encountering more widows who need the help and companionship to move on.$15#$e#...I hardly mind. I like having friends, and a good community can make any storm easier to weather.$21",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.26": "I sometimes wish the valley was slightly less pescatarian than it is. I like fish, I do.$15#$b#But I grew up on red meat, and would be lying to say I did not miss it.$13",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.27": "Therapists are excellent at keeping a striaght face, I will have you know.$21#$b#Part of our degree includes learning to ruminate in psy-lence.$14",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.28": "I rise rather early. My appointments start at eight in the morning, and I have quite a bit of hair to wrest into behaving before I can attend to them.$15",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.29": "Out of curiosity, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}, do you know anyone who would be willing to come out here for some light repairs?#$b#I hate to bother Robin with trivial matters, but the dog-house roof is beginning to leak.$9",
  "Aliyah.LowHeart.30": "If it was just a little closer, I would have liked to visit the Saloon more often. But just making the walk into town is an all-day affair...$9",

  // HIGH HEART
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.1": "Have you ever met a Shadow Person? They are very skittish, in the mines, and with good reason...$9#$e#But should you encounter one willing to talk, I find them lovely conversation.$1",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.2": "Yes, I have always known about the magic in the valley. I am sorry for not telling you sooner.$9#$e#Some things are simply better experienced for yourself.$15",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.3": "I sometimes catch junimos ambling through my garden. They were friends of my great-grandmother, after all.$14",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.4": "There are people in town who are more in-tune with magic than others. They can be quite insightful at times.$1#$b#Although, I think they may -also- believe I am a werewolf.$13",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.5": "I do treat some of the more esoteric members of the town on the sly.$0#$e#It is important to look after the whole of your community, even the hidden parts.$1",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.6": "I cannot really 'perform' magic, not in any way that I could show off or reign in...$9#$e#But I will live a very long time. I understand my pack, I am never troubled by the weather, and I can smell an oncoming storm...$1",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.7": "I always worry that I smile too broadly because of my teeth. Fangs are not an ideal trait for a therapist, are they?$15.#$e#I think perhaps I am just being self-conscious. Atzar always liked them... And they are a hit on Spirit's Eve.$8",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.8": "I was such a wild child, once. I have had to be fished out of trees more times than I can count, and I used to go leaping after moving things without thinking.$1#$b#I have more than a few scars from running afoul of a thorn bush. And the earful I got from our neighbors - why do you think I chase storms?$13",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.9": "I would give an arm and a leg for a perfume that smelled perfectly of petrichor.$20#$b#I have not found one yet, obviously. Though I have found several noble attempts.$21",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.10": "When I was younger, I wanted so very badly to be a mother, but it never came to pass.$30#$b#At least my path in life allows me to foster those around me. If I cannot have children, I can still have this.$18",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.11": "What are you reading lately, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}? I am having just the most fun with a comedic detective novel about a disgraced policeman trying to determine who has been burning his city down.$1#$b#It is dragons. Except dragons are not supposed to exist, you see, not the big ones.$14#$b#It is not even a spoiler, we find out about the dragon in the very first pages, the mystery is in finding out who is calling the beast, and how the entire affair will be resolved. Also I have read this nine times already. I really like this book.$8",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.12": "The wolves are like children to me. They are of course, all adults now, and they are wild animals; but they visit, they trust me.$21#$b#I have even been present for the birth of one or two of the pups, since moving here.$1",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.13": "May I share an amusing secret, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}? I have actually inherited a dreadfully keen prey drive. It is sometimes hard to repress.$14@$b#I cannot tell you how many times I have knocked something over at home trying to pounce on a fly.$3#$e#Wild rabbits are the worst of the lot. They are my favorite food, and something about how they dart across a field... That is actually where the scar on my lip comes from.$4",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.14": "Why do I love rain so much? It is somewhat difficult to explain, actually, but let me see...$15#$b#It makes me feel like some sort of pressure release has been loosened. A steam vent, opened up. I believe the technical term is 'stimming'.$8",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.15": "My house once belonged to my great-grandmother; the faerie in my lineage.$1#$b#She wanted to build a place where her descendents could thrive. I feel like she has succeeded, how about you?$22",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.16": "I never had children with Atzar, and at my age I have resigned myself to the notion that I never will.$30#$b#But it is all right. I have my community, and I have adopted a wolf pack.$21",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.17": "Every now and again I feel a tug deep in my heart to do something reckless.$20#$b#When I was young, it would get me in quite a bit of trouble. I would abandon my day to day, to run off for an adventure.$21#$e#These days, I go storm-chasing. I love the rain, and being struck by lightning does not hurt -that- much.$8#$e#....Just kidding, of course. That has not happened yet.$14",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.18": "It is not that I dislike cats - they are perfectly charming creatures, and friendly in their own language.$9#$b#But I do not understand them in the same intuitive way that I understand canines. I can have a conversation with a dog.$15",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.19": "Do you ever wonder what your life would look like under different circumstances?$21#$b#In another life, in another world, I think I might have liked learning to fly.$1",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.20": "I make sure that I have the means to be hospitable to anyone who comes to visit, be it a patient or a guest.$21#$b#There is always time to make coffee, brew tea, or pop a ginger ale and to talk. It is vital, I think, to make that time.$22",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.21": "I picked up a new book the other day - not for Book Club, it is just for me. It is... interesting.$21#$b#The story it tells on the surface is almost childishly simple, but the way the narrator speaks, and the meaning it finds in the simple is a second story unto itself, one that uses the surface-level as a springboard...$1",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.22": "I had a few very strange life lessons growing up. There was the typical, about personal safety and accountability...$21#$b#But there were also lessons on courtly etiquette, on the existence of magic, and how to spin thread from spider webs.$15",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.23": "I do have siblings - two younger brothers, who took their lives in far more wanderlusting a direction than I.$1#$b#I get postcards sometimes. No two have been from the same location, yet. Not even between the two of them.$8",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.24": "I like to think that despite everything, my life is perfectly normal, mundane, and relatable.$9#$b#But, if taken objectively, I do not know many people who have empassioned opinions on which season smells the best.$15#$e#It is autumn, by the way. Damp leaves, peat moss, and mushrooms put me in the mood for telling stories around a fire.$1",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.25": "I am glad that Spreach and the wolves get along. He is almost as big as they are, and that is not an argument I want to see play out.$15",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.26": "You have become a very dear friend to me, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}. I am glad.$21#$b#This valley would not be the same without you. I do hope you like it here as much as we like you.$1",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.27": "I am going to run the Widow's Book Club until we run out of things to read, I think. It is nice to have regular get-togethers with friends.$1#$b#...That being said, i hope we do not get any new members. Not for a long, long time.$15",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.28": "People seem surprised to learn that I am an adrenaline junkie, when I spend so much time reading.$15#$b#I fail to see how those two things conflict. As far as hobbies go, reading is a real page-turner.$14",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.29": "I entered a write-in joke contest the other week, with just under a dozen submissions...$9#$b#I think I should leave writing to Elliott and his family, though. Despite my hopes that one of my quips would win, no pun in ten did.$13",

They both love each other very dearly though, that much is obvious.$15",

My grocery bill has skyrocketed with my niece and nephew.$15#$b#I hate to think how much food would cost if we were still relying on imports for everything. You are truly a life-saver, farmer.$13",
  "Aliyah.Nieblings.9": "Last week, Miguel was talking avidly about a new start up he was joining to sell personalized perfume scents online.$9#$b#This week, it is personally-curated musical compositions to study to. He has been planning a quiz-based submission form for accuracy.$9#$b#He has so much energy, and so much constant enthusiasm, it is hard to judge what is going to stick, and what will not.$15",
  "Aliyah.Nieblings.10": "I am glad my niece and nephew have very distinct favorite colors. It makes it very easy to sort the laundry, despite a lack of familiarity.$1#$b#Red? That goes to Raquel. Green? Up to Miguel, then. And of course, anything blue is most likely mine - but I already knew which clothes I own.$14",
  "Aliyah.Nieblings.11": "It turns out Miguel and I have similar tastes in books! That was fun to find out.$22#$b#He does not hang around during Book Club, but he always shows up right as it ends to ask about what we're reading this time. He really is such a sweet young man.$1",
  "Aliyah.Nieblings.12": "Raquel is a phenominal cook; it makes sense, given she has been managing her own household for some time now.$21#$b#She has been sharing recipes with me, and vice-versa. Doing so has become a weekly get-together, as we meal plan with one another.$22",
  "Aliyah.Nieblings.13": "Does Miguel also remind you of a puppy, or is it only me who sees that?$20",
  "Aliyah.Nieblings.14": "Does Raquel also remind you of a guard dog, or is it only me who sees that?$20",
  "Aliyah.Nieblings.15": "I was not sure how it was going to go, taking in my niece and nephew, but I can truly say that my life has not been this full in years.$1#$b#I was nervous that we would not get along! I am glad that I worried for nothing.$18",

  "Aliyah.Dahlia.1": "Miss Hellebore - Dahlia - seems to find joy in every little thing, does she not?$20#$b#Honestly, it is supremely charming, and that energy is something I think people could stand to learn from.$21",
  "Aliyah.Dahlia.2": "I just ran into miss Hellebore, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}, and she asked me roughly fifty questions about you.$18#$b#Strange things, too. About heroism, morality, if you had some sort of code...? I had no idea, and told her as much, but...$9#$b#Are you two friends? What in the stars do you two talk about, farmer?$15",
  "Aliyah.Dahlia.3": "I cannot quite figure out where it is that miss Hellebore - er, Dahlia - lives. She must rouse awfully early, I only ever encounter her out and about.$15",
  "Aliyah.Dahlia.4": "I do think it is sweet, how much miss Hellebore seems to simply... like people? She is very kind to just about everyone in town.$21#$b#I have even seen her go out of her way to tell the local strays what she likes about them. It is terribly endearing.$8",
  "Aliyah.Dahlia.5": "Miss Hellebore - er, Dahlia - she reminds me of my great-grandmother at times. Which, let me tell you, is a feat unto itself.$15",
  // SEASONAL 
  "Aliyah.Spring.1": "It is dandelion season. If you dehydrate the roots, you can make a tea from them that I am especially fond of...$1",
  "Aliyah.Spring.2": "I find spring to be charming, personally. It is full of life, but without the bombast of summer, or melancholy of fall.$0#$e#It reminds me of children playing. Is that strange?$21",
  "Aliyah.Spring.3": "I feel bad for people with pollen allergies. Spring is a long way from the relief that winter brings.$9",
  "Aliyah.Spring.4": "The animals seem livelier this time of year. Perhaps it is because there are so many new mothers in spring.$15",
  "Aliyah.Spring.5": "You seem especially peppy, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}. It is almost as if there is a 'spring' in your step.$22",

  "Aliyah.Summer.2": "Nothing puts me more at ease than a summer thunderstorm. There is something so humbling about the bellowing sky...$1",
  "Aliyah.Summer.3": "If you are too warm, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}, you can always get 'summ-more' ice cream from the stand near the library.$3",
  "Aliyah.Summer.4": "Do you have many fireflies out by %farm? They fly past my windows in the garden at home.$8#$e#I have been curling up with tea and a book on the swing to watch them. It is nice.$1",
  "Aliyah.Summer.5": "I am not exactly a hot house flower, but I would rather it be warm than cold. You must be busy, though.$15",
  "Aliyah.Summer.6": "I am surprised we do not get more tourism this time of year. We have a lovely beachfront, after all.$8#$b#You would think that people would flock here, to sea all they could sea.$14",
  "Aliyah.Fall.1": "Fall has my favorite festivals. I love the barbecue at the fair, and Spirit's Eve...$1",
  "Aliyah.Fall.2": "Storms notwithstanding, sweater weather is my favorite weather.$8#$e#Not that I dislike my warm weather wardrobe, but I have a fondness for this old turtle-neck...$1",
  "Aliyah.Fall.3": "When I was growing up, fall was a time for big roasts on open flames, communal meals...$1#$e#I would be lying to say I did not sometimes miss it.$12",
  "Aliyah.Fall.4": "I know that autumn is a busy time of year for you, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}...$13#$b#I appreciate your company, but do not 'fall' behind on your work, now.$14",
  "Aliyah.Fall.5": "Soon it will be winter, and food and warmth will be scarce beyond the walls of our homes.$11#$e#But not yet. No, not yet.$12",
  "Aliyah.Fall.6": "You would not be-leaf how arbor-ent the leaf litter is being. Spreach keeps jumping into every pile just as it has been raked.$15",

  "Aliyah.Winter.6": "Are you cold? Please allow me to winter-vene.... [{{Coffee}}]$22",
  // BOOK CLUB
  "Aliyah.BookClub.1": "The book we're reading for club right now is Sci-Fi, which I will confess, is not typically my first choice.$15#$b#I thought it was very enjoyable, though - there was a stronger emotional throughline than I was expecting. I am looking forward to hearing what everyone else thought.$1",
  "Aliyah.BookClub.2": "I got to pick what we read for book club this time, so I chose something I had yet to read from my favorite author, Perry Thatchett.$21#$b#I enjoy his comedic timing, and how he couches real insight in a costume of fantasy tropes. I hope everyone else received it well...$15",
  "Aliyah.BookClub.3": "We are reading something so dreadfully serious at book club at the moment, and I am embarrassed to admit, I am having trouble getting through it.$17#$b#It is beautifully written, and poignant and thought-provoking, but I prefer a touch of levity to soften dark subject matter.$9",
  "Aliyah.BookClub.4": "Someone chose the sappiest, most saccharine romance I have ever read in my life for the book club, and oh my goodness, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}},$18#$b#It is so flowery, but it is so funny. Sky above and starlight, I cannot read it in public without giggling.$4",
  "Aliyah.BookClub.5": "We are doing something a little bit different at book club currently, and the concept has just been tickling me since it was proposed. May I share?$$22#$e#We are reading the translation of a novel that was originally published in a different language - all except Beatrice, who is reading the original.$20#$b#I am very excited to compare how the translation stands up against its original incarnation.$1",
  "Aliyah.BookClub.6": "We are reading one of the old classics in book club, right now! I have not read 'A Fold In Time' in ages, pardon the pun.$22#$b#I thought it was so boring when I was forced to read it in school, but I am having a wonderful time revisiting it again. Maybe I can suggest more of these.$21",
  "Aliyah.BookClub.7": "We are reading an amateur screen-play in book club right now. It is a fascinating experience.$1#$b#It is definitely not something I would have sought out myself, but the unique format scratches an itch in a way I cannot quite describe. I have found it to be a fun 'theatre of the mind' exercise.$22",

  "Aliyah.GiftReaction.BluCoffee": "Mm! This is not how I make coffee, but...$21#$b#A bit of blueberry syrup is inspired. It improves the natural acidity, and is just the right amount of sweet.$22",
  "Aliyah.GiftReaction.CarCoffee": "Mm! This is not how I make coffee, but...$21#$b#Caramel really makes a cup of coffee rather rich, do you not think? It is much sweeter than mine, but that is nice for a treat.$22",
  "Aliyah.GiftReaction.ChoCoffee": "Mm! This is not how I make coffee, but...$21#$b#Chocolate is just indulgent, is it not? I think a mocha is perhaps the only kind of coffee I ever want to take with milk...$22",

  "Aliyah.Intro.QQ.2": "I'm sorry, I had other errands to run today. But thank you!",
  "Aliyah.Intro.A.1": "Wonderful. Please come along, as I really do need to refrigerate some of this sooner, rather than later.$1",
  "Aliyah.Intro.A.2": "Aliyah leads you up to her house on the northern end of the Deep Mountains for coffee, and a bit more conversation before you part ways.",

  "Aliyah.1H.B7": "Mmm...? Well, as long as you keep putting yourself out there, I am sure you will make friends. You seem to have quite the lucky streak.$14#$b#Normally, for example, I would have been grocery shopping on Sunday, but happened to have needed an additional shop on the day we first met.$8",
  "Aliyah.1H.B8": "Oh. Do not mind me; I simply find such moments of serendipity to be charming, is all. Little reminders of how chance affects us all.$1#$b#Regardless, I also should be heading home to begin supper. I wish you a safe walk home, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}} - do mind the crabs that come out after dark.$13#$b#And please always feel free to drop by, should it suit you.$1",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.1": "{{Honorific}} {{Surname}}, this is a fine surprise. Welcome.$21",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.2": "You have happened upon Widows Book Club. We meet semi-weekly to discuss a book we all agreed to read.$8",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.Book.1": "This week, I am eager to discuss a hidden gem from the Cubeworld series$1#$b#Unlike most of the work from Perry Thatchett, this one was written to be a stand-alone exploration of war and oligarchy.$8#$b#He is my favorite author, and I am excited to see if everyone else enjoyed his writing as much as I do. It is, after all, very funny.$14",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.Book.2": "This week, we are reading a newly-published historical romance novel written in the style of the classics.$21#$b#And I think the author did a fine job of capturing both the pace and the feeling of the classics, while writing something more relevant to modern tastes.$22#$b#If that is your cup of tea, I would happy to lend you my copy? Later, of course.$1",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.Book.3": "This week, someone picked a thrilling spy novel that is equal parts action and intrigue.$22#$b#It had ingenious page formatting as well - entire paragraphs split down the middle or sectioned off diagonally with purpose....$8#$b#Which did a fantastic job of putting the readers in the shoes of both spies, successfully portraying both of their viewpoints without muddling things.$22#$b#I feel like I have seen poetry that does something similar - regardless, I wholly recommend this one.$21",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.Book.4": "This week, we have dipped our toes into a suspenseful horror novel written by someone I had not yet heard of, prior.$15#$b#I am always very iffy about horror, if I am to be honest - I like it in theory, but in practice I often find works of horror to be sensationalist before they are tense.$9#$b#Which... fortunately, was not an issue this week. Very much outside my comfort zone, but it was gripping in a way that I very much enjoyed.$1",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.Book.5": "This week, we read a draft of something one of my college friends has been working on.$22#$b#She is an aspiring novellist living in Zuzu, and she gave me my permission to share her manuscript with the Club, to get some outside eyes on it.$1#$b#So naturally, I am very keen to hear what everyone else thought of her work. I need to report back, after all.$14",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.Book.6": "This week, we read something I can only truly describe as a 'space opera'.$8#$b#Sci-fi is not typically my genre of choice, but the backdrop of the void made the tangled narrative all the more compelling, I think.$1#$b#It certainly put a time limit on how long the characters had to indulge in various shenanigans. Interpersonal drama tends to explode in a confined space.$22",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.Book.7": "This week, we read something light and charming - translated folk tales from the Emerald Inlet.$21#$b#I have always been particularly fond of folklore and fables, and reading some from abroad was a true treat.$22#$b#Of course, I am interested in seeing what everyone else thought of the book as well. It was a departure from the longer works we tend to read.$13",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.Book.8": "This week, we read a collection of short stories that do not interconnect with one another until you get to the last few.$21#$b#At which point the entire collection is thrown into a whole new perspective as you realize the truth underlying beneath each isolated snippet of prose.$13#$b#But they were a mystery collection, so I do not want to spoil too much. I would recommend this one, though, if you are interested.$22",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.Book.9": "This week, we revisited some of the old classics from our collective childhoods, giving them some fresh eyes.$21#$b#It is something I like to do periodically, and I am glad the rest of the club agreed - sometimes we do not read books at the right point in our lives for them to have an impact.$9#$b#The trip down memory lane has been a pleasant one, though.$22",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.Gossip.1": "And of course, with everyone here, we also need to talk about something Jodi told me about her son....$8#$b#Evidently, the young man seems to have developed a fondness for Penny.$14",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.Gossip.2": "And of course, with everyone here, we also need to talk about something Marnie mentioned this week...$8#$b#Not to get into her personal life overmuch, but there have been some tentative developments in the romance department that will be fun to celebrate...$22",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.Gossip.3": "And of course, with everyone here, now is the perfect opportunity to share something that the Mayor spoke to me about.$8#$b#Regarding some of the festivals the town puts on, and a new budget that may have been approved...$1",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.Gossip.4": "And of course, with everyone here, I absolutely must tell everyone what Spreach found in the yard.$8#$b#The pup has a nose for trouble, but this time it may wind up being rather entertaining trouble, depending...$21",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.Gossip.5": "And of course, with everyone here, I imagine there may be an announcement or two coming from within our ranks?$8#$b#Not to name any names or anything, but a few people have been especially keen to have our get-together this week.$14",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.Gossip.6": "And of course, with everyone here, evidently Willy made something of a find in his nets this past week that is worth talking about.$8#$b#Beatrice says she saw whatever it was off the coast, and that it slipped away just in time....$21",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.Gossip.7": "And of course, with everyone here, I did want to pick a few brains about what everyone makes of Aideen's mood as of late.$8#$b#She is acting more aflutter than usual, and I rather suspect she may have found someone.$22",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.Gossip.8": "And of course, with everyone here, it is imperative that we plan something nice to surprise Robin.$8#$b#She never attends personally, as she has remarried, but she always gets a touch gloomy around the date of the anniversary of her first marriage.$30",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.Gossip.9": "And of course, with everyone here, we absolutely must compare notes in regards to the whirlwind of crushes that consumes the younger generation.$8#$b#I believe there have been a few developments in town and I am eager to be apprised.",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.3": "...But that is just hearsay, of course.$21#$b#Regardless - We are about to begin our discussion. Perhaps we can catch up some other time?$15",
  "Aliyah.BookMeet.4": "Until next time, then. Do not be a stranger, farmer.$1",
  "Aliyah.2H.1": "Good afternoon, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}. You have met Spreach, have you not?$1",
  "Aliyah.2H.QQA1": "S...Sprig, sorry? Your dog's name is Sprig?",
  "Aliyah.2H.QQA2": "Afternoon! What're you doing all the way out in the Cindersap, Doc?",
  "Aliyah.2H.A1": "Close. It is pronounced with a longer 'ea' sound, like in 'spread'. Spreach.$15#$b#Spreach is an Emerald Wolfhound, so I wanted to name him something in Inlettish. His name means 'Sparky' on the Emerald Inlet.$8",
  "Aliyah.2H.A2": "BOUF!!$1#$b#%Spreach's tail wags furiously at the sound of his name.", // For Translators: BOUF is a loud, deep, bassy dog bark. Spreach is very happy.
  "Aliyah.2H.A3": "He is quite fond of people, so please do not be intimidated by his size. He is as much a gentle giant as I am.$14",
  "Aliyah.2H.A4": "But, it is a pleasant surprise to run into you out here. What brings you to the Cindersap, farmer?$1",
  "Aliyah.2H.B1": "Marnie is a friend of mine, so I bring Spreach around to visit when he has too much energy.$8",
  "Aliyah.2H.B2": "Aph! Arrowororf!$1", // For Translators: Aph! Arrowrorf! is an excited, yapping dog noise. Spreach is energetic.
  "Aliyah.2H.B3": "...Which, as you can see, applies very much today.$15",
  "Aliyah.2H.B4": "No need to worry about him, however. What brings you to the Cindersap, farmer?$1",
  "Aliyah.2H.QQB1": "Oh, you know, farm chores - needed some lumber, wanted to see if Marnie was in...",
  "Aliyah.2H.QQB2": "Well, WOOD you believe I just can't LEAF these trees alone?",
  "Aliyah.2H.C1": "I.. believe Marnie is home. She was outside a few moments ago, but I am not sure if she went back inside...$9#$b#If you like, I could -?$9",
  "Aliyah.2H.C2": "BARK! BARK BARK BARK!$5", // For Translators: Spreach has seen a squirrel and is barking as he starts to run after it.
  "Aliyah.2H.C3": "Oh - oh dear, I think he saw a squirrel. I am sorry, farmer - I need to keep him out of trouble. Do take care!$7",
  "Aliyah.2H.D1": "Did you just...?$7",
  "Aliyah.2H.D2": "Pfffahahaha! Farmer - that was, that was awful!$3", // For Translators: Aliyah is reaking into laughter.
  "Aliyah.2H.D3": "Of all the silly nonsense you could have come up with, really now -$13",
  "Aliyah.2H.D4": "BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK!$5", // For Translators: Spreach has seen a squirrel and is barking as he starts to run after it.
  "Aliyah.2H.D5": "Ack, I think he saw a squirrel - I am sorry, I need to go and catch him before this becomes a problem. Please take care, farmer! I will see you some other time - !$7",
  "Aliyah.3H.1": "Hello there, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}! Fancy meeting you here.$22",
  "Aliyah.3H.NQ.1": "Aliyah! Spreach! Good to see you! Bit of a walk, isn't it?",
  "Aliyah.3H.NQ.2": "What are you two doing down here in the Scarp?",
  "Aliyah.3H.2": "I beg your pardon? I happen to live here, more or less. It is a much longer walk to %farm farm. $14#$b#%Aliyah's grin is faint but warm, crinkling her eyes at the corners.",
  "Aliyah.3H.3": "What brings you out this way, farmer?$1",
  "Aliyah.3H.QQ.1": "Just taking a walk. It feels nice to wander.",
  "Aliyah.3H.QQ.2": "Errands, mostly - oh, did you need anything, since I'm around?",
  "Aliyah.3H.A1": "Ah, so that would mean you're free right now?$20",
  "Aliyah.3H.A2": "I was thinking perhaps I could treat you to coffee, today. Come, I will even show you how I make it, this time.$21",
  "Aliyah.3H.A3": "I learned to make coffee like this shortly after I moved here, actually. While I was still studying psychiatry, someone quite dear to me taught me.$21",

  "Aliyah.3H.A5": "You remind me a bit of when I first moved here, you know.$15",
  "Aliyah.3H.A6": "I had just started postgrad, and I was always scrambling all over to be neighborly. I see you making a familiar runaround...$13",
  "Aliyah.3H.A7": "I think that it speaks well of you. I appreciate the effort you have made to visit, despite the trek to get here.$1#$b#I just also want you to know that you can drop by any time you need to simply rest. Farm work is demanding, after all. I will make time for you.$22",
  "Aliyah.3H.A8": "I want to be sure you understand that I mean it. Do not be a stranger, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}.$21",

  "Aliyah.3H.B5": "You remind me a bit of when I first moved here, you know.$15",
  "Aliyah.3H.B6": "I had just started postgrad, and I was always scrambling all over to be neighborly. I see you making a familiar runaround...$13#$b#It... worries me, if I am to be honest.$17",
  "Aliyah.3H.B7": "I think that it speaks well of you. But I remember going to such lengths trying to please everyone, that I burnt myself out.$9#$b#In light of that, I wish to extend invitation and reassurance; please come visit whenever you need a break. I will make time to sit and have coffee with you.$15#$b#Or tea, if you prefer.$1",
  "Aliyah.3H.B8": "I want to be sure you understand that I mean it. Do not be a stranger, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}.$21",

  "Aliyah.4H.QN.A2": "Just wandering. What are you doing?",
  "Aliyah.4H.2": "This is the grave of my late husband. I was just tidying it, you are more than welcome to linger. He would have liked the company.$22",

  "Aliyah.4H.QN.B2": "Do you need an ear?",

  "Aliyah.4H.QQ.A1": "What was your husband's name?",
  "Aliyah.4H.QQ.A2": "What was your husband like?",
  "Aliyah.4H.A1": "His name was Atzar Toirneach; he took my surname after marriage. Though he went by many, many other things.$20",
  "Aliyah.4H.A2": "He was a Gotoran man. I met him at the Night Market, he used to travel with them when I had first moved here, telling stories with shadows on a silk screen.$21#$b#He was the one who taught me to make coffee in hot sand, he planted half these flower boxes, he -$4",

  "Aliyah.5H.4": "Rrrf...",

  "Aliyah.6H.QQ.A1": "Hey, Aliyah... this might be a weird question, but - what ARE you, really?",
  "Aliyah.6H.QQ.A2": "Hey, uh, Doc? I've been wondering, are you a werewolf?",
  "Aliyah.6H.QN.A1": "Well, there was that time you didn't jump when lightning struck right behind you....",
  "Aliyah.6H.QN.A2": "Well, there was that time I ran into you and a bunch of wolves in the woods....",
  "Aliyah.6H.A1": "That seems a bit out of the blue. May I ask why you are phrasing it that way, in particular?$12",
  "Aliyah.6H.A2": "Oh, very well. Well done, {{Honorific}} {{Surname}}. You caught me.$1",
  "Aliyah.6H.A3": "You would be correct in assuming that I am not fully human. Mostly human, yes, but my great-grandmother was rather more than mortal.$22#$b#The very same great-grandmother that built this house, and left it to me, as it were. She was... mm.$21",

  "Aliyah.6H.B2": "So what was it that caught your attention, hum...?$1",
  "Aliyah.6H.B3": "Ah, yes, that would do it, would it not...? Well, you are very clever - I am not a werewolf, but I am not fully human, either.$15",
  "Aliyah.6H.B4": "I am, mostly human. But my great-grandmother was rather more than mortal.$22#$b#The very same great-grandmother that built this house, and left it to me, as it were. She was... mm.$21",
  "Aliyah.6H.2": "Have you ever heard of the Junimo?$15",
  "Aliyah.6H.3": "No - no she was not a Junimo herself. Do not look at me like that. I would not be this tall.$3#$b#But she was a nature spirit, much as Junimo are, albeit a very different sort.$21",

  "Dahlia.LowHeart.15": "What are your opinions on videos game? Sam just explained them to me, and I really want to try one now...!$3",

  // HIGH HEART - 6H Event +
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.1": "I meant it - I really am an actress. It's just that most of my performances are, um... candid? Not so much on a stage...$25",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.2": "I really do love people, you know. I admire them - their creativity, their presence in everyday life...$7#$b#A lot of fae just kind of... float through existence.$18",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.3": "It's so much warmer here than I'm used to. Home was covered in perpetual snow; I love all the new colors, but I hate the heat.$3",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.4": "I'm really glad you met me 'now', I think. I haven't always liked people. I haven't always been interested in being kind.$14#$e#My nature is to change, after all. I won't always be this, either, but I like me right now.$7",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.5": "You're not at all what I expected, did you know that? I was imaginging someone larger than life, someone bombastic...$19#$e#I'm not complaining. Different isn't bad. It's nice to be surprised by kindness.$7",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.6": "I was scared, you know, to let people know what I am. People tell a lot of scary stories about faeries, and most of them are true.$11#$e#It's nice to let go of that fear. Still, I'm sorry for misleading you, farmer.$15",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.7": "I can't lie. I just can't, it's not something fae can do. That's why I asked you to lie for me when we met - sorry about that.$25#$e#If I acted like we were close, and you corroborated the idea, then I could just exist in that loophole.#27",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.8": "Hm? Crop fairies? Sounds like they're part of the spring court. I'm from winter - I can do a lot of things with magic, but not that.$7",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.9": "I was not born, I cannot die. I must speak truth, my words can't lie. Illusion still can draw the eye to woven web of false design.$12#$e#...Hm. I think that last one was only half a rhyme...$3",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.10": "You don't think less of me now that I've decided to linger, do you {{DahlPetName}}? You don't really seem the type, but...$19#$b#It seems so silly to leave, now. I feel like something's taken root here, in the Valley. I want to see what it is.$7",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.11": "I still say this town needs a Community Theatre. Especially since I'm staying! Or a talent night, or something - I should bother the Mayor.$1",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.12": "I've always loved stories, as far back as I can remember - and I can remember a lot!$6#$e#Fairies retell the stories we've heard over and over, but I've only truly heard new ones when I was living with humans. Like yours! It's why I like you so much.$7",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.13": "Evelyn's been teaching me about gardening. And Leah! I'm helping them both out where I can - Aideen, too.$6#$e#I don't do it for money. It's just for fun. And real flowers are nicer than my silk ones at home, anyway.$1",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.14": "You know, there's a lot of humans in the world - but you're the best, and my most favorite of all of them!$6#$b#Hm? Why?$3#$b#Because you were available to waylay one morning!$1#$e#...What? It's enough for me!$6",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.15": "Oh, my, feels just like I don't try - look so good I might cry, all I know is -$12#$b#Every-body LOVES me!$23",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.16": "So the reason I'm always iffy about cooked foods and stuff is that I'm an obligate carnivore...$15#$b#Plants and starches have a lot of complex sugars, and they can make me sick if I eat more than like, a tiny amount.$25",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.17": "Learning to garden for real has been a struggle, but a rewarding one. I may only have silk flowers in the grove, but my flowerbox is blooming.$7",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.18": "Some fae take being long-lived as a curse, or an excuse to live slow, boring, glacial lives.$19#$b#I never understood the appeal of stagnation. The world is putting on a performance, and a beautiful one at that. I'll see it all one day.$6",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.19": "I think Evelyn might just be the nicest person in town, what do you think?$7#$b#She's teaching me to look after flowers! So I run errands for her, when her grandson's too busy. I love her a lot a lot a lot.$6",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.20": "Hey {{DahlPetName}}! If you could suddenly talk to anything - trees, animals, rocks, all of it - what would you strike up a conversation with first?$1",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.21": "I sat in on Penny's lessons the other day. I think I may have confused her, but the kids seemed really excited to see me.$7#$b#She was a good sport, too. Maybe I could offer singing lessons if she ever gets tired?$3",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.22": "The Grove is cold all year round, even in the height of summer. Honestly, it's the only way I make it through that season...$25",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.23": "Do you ever wonder how many immortals live in the Valley? We don't exactly go out of our way to advertise...$19#$b#Every now and then, I feel like I should go track them down. I wanna be neighborly! And I want more friends.$7",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.24": "The fact that you can literally do magic and wield any number of weapons is so neat, {{DahlPetName}}.$1#$b#So is the fact that despite that, you're focusing on a simple, hollistic life. You're very neat in general.$7",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.25": "So Sam lent me his hand videos game box to try, and pointed me to try the Legend of Zalgo, Chains of the Past.$3#$b#I... I can't put it down. Help? I have other things I wanted to do today!$13",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.26": "I had a wonderful conversation with Linus the other day. He's a treasure, honestly. It's calming to meet someone who just understands.$7",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.27": "You know, initially, I'd thought about hiding my ears and pretending to be human.$24#$b#I gave up on that idea way before I came to say hello. People are refreshingly accepting of magic around here.$1",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.28": "Sometimes I entertain the idea of turning into a butcher-bird and going to sing for Eloise. I know she'd appreciate it.$6#$b#But when I didn't come back for a while after that, I think she'd worry. They don't migrate much. And she would know that.$28",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.29": "Do you know how impressive you all are, {{DahlPetName}}? Most humans don't know magic, and you only live for a century at most...$15#$b#And despite this, you've changed the whole world so that it's more comfortable for you, so it can support you...$7",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.30": "Sometimes I think it would be nice to be able to dip into the magic from other seasons. Winter lingers in endings, both gentle and heavy-handed, transient and permanent.$7#$b#But since I've started to learn to garden, I've changed my tune. It's nice to watch things grow slowly. I earned those flowers.$6",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.31": "Stories get told, I hear the plot-lines unfold, It seems they're handin me gold, oooh - $12#$b#Stories get told here at the mid-night movies!$23",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.32": "...And after midnight we're all the same - no glass shoe to bring us fame, nobody to take the blame. We're falling apart$12#$b#Every story's a waiting game - a flower for every name; their colors are paling in the falling rain...$23",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.33": "So I caught up with Haley and explained that this is just my natural lip color, finally. She said I was -cool-!$14#$b#She's like, the trendiest person in town! And she thinks I'm cool? I'm going to be on the moon about this for at least a week.$6",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.34": "Leah's teaching me to cook! Kind of! Here, I made this, you can have it.$1[651]#$b#I can't eat it! And I don't want it going to waste, so it's yours now.$7",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.35": "Pink is definitely the best part about leaving Faerie. And green, too, green is also amazing.$7#$b#All the bright colors out here are great, but those two are my favorite.$6",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.36": "Sooo, quick question, {{DahlPetName}}, what are your thoughts on ice skating?$6#$b#Because I could totally freeze part of the lake for a bit if ... wait, do you even have skates? Never mind, then.$19",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.37": "I was talking to Spreach, Dr. Aliyah's dog? And well, he doesn't really talk back, not to me anyway, but I IMAGINE he said something like,$7#$b#'Oh, @ is so nice! I see him on walks with Aliyah all the time!' Or something like that. He's a good boy.$6",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.38": "I don't know if you're super lucky, or if I am. Not all faeries are nice. Some of them are even needlessly cruel.$15#$b#But I have decided to love and guard you for the rest of your life, instead. Because I think you're neat.$6",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.39": "Jasper's kind of funny, isn't he? He's really interested in dwarves and their culture, and I don't think he's even noticed my ears.$6#$b#That's some serious dedication! And some serious tunnel-vision!$1",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.40": "Aideen's flowers are so-so pretty, and she reminds me of some people I used to know ages and ages ago. I love her.$6$#b#I do wonder how she can stand wearing that many layers all the time, though. I always feel like I'm going to melt when I wear more than this.$19",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.41": "The things people take for granted sometimes... Like, even just, having a body. You were born with one! You'll keep it your whole life.$7#$b#Maybe that sounds mundane to you, but that's not how having a body works for me. I have to decide on what mine will be, every time I leave Faerie.$27",

  "Dahlia.6H.A1.1": "Short version, got it: Faerie, the place, and Faeries, the people, are kind of intertwined. Which means, back at home, I don't really have a body unless I want to.$6#$b#I'm more like a sentient dream, and I make myself a physical form so I can talk to people.$19",

  "Dahlia.6H.A2.2": "I am a Faerie. And Faeries come from Faerie. Faerie the place, and Faerie the people are called the same thing, because we honestly are the same thing.$7#$b#Faerie, the place, is more similar to dreams than it is the material world,$1#$b#And Faeries, the people, are snippets of willpower and consciousness that are a part of that dream. Myself included!$6",
  "Dahlia.6H.A2.3": "I am winter. The concept of it, the memory of it, the impression people have of it. I'm a living concept, with feelings and opinions and memories.$7#$b#But what I don't have, at least, something that isn't inherent - is a body. You were born with yours, but mine is something I came up with on my own.$6#$b#And at any time, if it ever stops being useful or if it stops feeling like mine, I can leave it behind, and go back to being a dream for a while.$25",
  "Dahlia.6H.A2.4": "I've done it before. Dropped bodies like costumes that don't fit, and found something else to be. But even so...$19#$b#I like being on Material. So I've spent a lot of my life with a body, since it lets me talk to people - just, not always the same body.$6",
  "Dahlia.6H.A2.5": "I am not my body, my body is mine. I don't think anyone is their body, but I've found that most people have a hard time separating 'self' from 'shape'.$25#$b#Whereas I'm just taking this physical form on a joy ride.$1#$b#...Um, that was it. Anything else?$25",
  "Dahlia.6H.QQ.C1": "Yeah, I think you're being too hard on yourself. I'm glad I could help, and I forgive you.",
  "Dahlia.6H.QQ.C2": "Yeah, I don't really get why you're apologising. This whole thing has been fun, and I don't regret it.",
  "Dahlia.6H.B1": "You mean that? After everything, after how much I've been pulling you along, you just.. forgive me, like that?$15#$b#...Thank you. I'm going to remember this. Your kindness means a lot, and just... Well. Here.$27",
  "Dahlia.6H.C1": "You mean that? It was fun? You've actually enjoyed this wave of chaos I brought into your life?$15#$b#...Thank you. I'm going to remember this. Your kindness means a lot, and just... Well. Here.$27",
  "Dahlia.6H.9": "Those will grow my favorite flowers, if you decide to plant them. They're called dahlias. I thought they were so pretty that I named myself after them.$25",
