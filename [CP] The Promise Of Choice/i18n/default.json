  "Aliyah.HighHeart.7": "I always worry about smiling too broadly because of my teeth. Fangs are not an ideal trait for a therapist, are they?$15.$9#$e#I think perhaps I am just being self-conscious. Pietre always liked them... And they are a hit on Spirit's Eve.$8",
  "Aliyah.HighHeart.8": "I was such a wild child, once. I have had to be fished out of trees more times than I can count, and I used to go leaping after moving things without thinking.$1#$b#I have more than a few scars from running afoul of a thorn bush.

  "Dahlia.HighHeart.4": "I'm really glad you met me 'now', I think. I haven't always liked people. I haven't always been interested in being kind.$14#$e#My nature is to change, after all. I won't always be this, either, but I like me right now.$7",

  "Dahlia.HighHeart.7": "I can't lie. I just can't, it's not something fae can do. That's why I asked you to lie for me when we met - sorry about that.$10#$e#If I acted like we were close, and you corroborated the idea, then I could just exist in that loophole.#14",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.8": "Hm? Crop fairies? Sounds like they're part of the spring court. I'm from winter - I can do a lot of things with magic, but not that.$7",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.9": "I was not born, I cannot die. I must speak truth, my words can't lie. Illusion still can draw the eye to woven web of false design.$12#$e#...Hm. I think that last one was only half a rhyme...$3",
  "Dahlia.HighHeart.10": "You don't think less of me now that I've decided to linger, do you {{DahlPetName}}? You don't really seem the type, but...$19#$b#It seems so silly to leave, now. I feel like something's taken root here, in the Valley. I want to see what it is.$7",

  "Dahlia.Spring.5": "Do you have any baby animals on your farm? 'Tis the season, after all.",

  "Dahlia.Fall.4": "Pumpkin pie smells really good. Really, really good. I can't eat it, but I wonder if I should learn to make it anyway?$19",
  "Dahlia.Fall.5": "In a world flush with color, and smelling of peat, smoke and spice...$7#$b#...The cool air nips the burnished bronze leaves from the trees to keep them, one, by one, by one~$12",
  "Dahlia.Winter.1": "It's my favorite, favorite season. There's something so intimate, so enchanting, about a world covered in snow.$7",
  "Dahlia.Winter.2": "Huh? Am I cold? No, not really. I've always been the most comfortable in cold weather.$3",
  "Dahlia.Winter.3": "There's not much time to grow this time of year, is there? Are you taking the time to enjoy it? Are you sleeping in?$1#$b#Or are you spending all your time in the mines? Have fun either way!$6",
  "Dahlia.Winter.4": "Something about the scarcity of daylight this time of year makes it precious, I think. Make sure to treasure it, @.$7",

"Dahlia.Intro.2": "You moved here pretty recently, right? I've only just arrived myself, and I really don't know anyone yet... You seem like THE person to know, though?$15",
"Dahlia.Intro.3": "SO, I thought I could pretend to know you already, and that ought to smooth things over with fitting in! Don't you think?$14",
"Dahlia.Intro.4": "All that said - !$6",
"Dahlia.Intro.5": "Should I play a visiting childhood friend? A penpal come to live nearby? Maybe a rekindled old flame?$1",
"Dahlia.Intro.QQ1": "Let's go with a childhood friend.",
"Dahlia.Intro.QQ2": "A penpal sounds fun!",
"Dahlia.Intro.QQ3": "Old... flame?",
"Dahlia.IntroA.1": "An old friend? Okay! I can do that! We'll need to collaborate a bit so I can play it believably, but - oh, thank you so much for this!$6",
"Dahlia.IntroA.2": "You can call me 'Dahlia' - you have to make sure that you say hello when you see me, okay? There's so much to catch up on.$7",
